# Analysis of winning strategies in the game "Pebbles"

## Task condition

Let's consider a simplified version of the game. Given **one** pile containing `n` stones. Two players take turns making moves. In one turn, the player can remove 1, 2 or 3 stones from the pile **. The player who takes the last stone wins.

**Task:** For a given initial number of `n` stones, determine which player has a winning strategy with optimal play by both players.

## Requirements

1. To study the theoretical foundations of the game "Pebbles"
2. Prove the criterion for winning a position
3. Develop an algorithm for determining a winning strategy
4. Give examples of how the algorithm works

## Solution format

- Mathematical proof of the theorem
- Algorithm for determining the winning strategy
- Examples for different initial values of `n`

### Features of this task:

- **Simpler than the original** - only one pile instead of several
- **Limited moves** - you can only take 1, 2 or 3 stones (instead of any number from any pile)
- **Easier to analyze** - simple pattern of winning/losing positions
- **Good for beginners** - allows you to understand the basics of game theory using a simple example

This task is great for getting to know combinatorial games and winning strategies for the first time.
